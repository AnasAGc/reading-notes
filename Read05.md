## Comparison Operators
are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.


|   Operator   |  Description 
|--------------|--------------
|     ==       |  equal to
|     ===      |  equal cvalue and Data type
|     !=       |  not equal 
|     !==      |  not equal value  and Data type 
|     >        |  greater than 
|     <        |  less than 
|     >=       |  greater than or equal to 
|     <=       |  less than ot equal to 

## Example 
 
```

 if (yes = "yes" = 'nice to have you here ')
 
```


## Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.

|   Operator   |  Description 
|--------------|--------------
|     &&       |  equal to
|     ||       |  equal cvalue and Data type .
|     !        |  not equal 

## Example 

```

	(x == 5 || y == 5) is false

```

## Loops

we use loops if we want to run some code over and over again until specific condition is met .

### The For Loop

It has has the following syntax:

```
for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```
Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.

Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.

Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.

### The while Loop

 loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

```
while (condition) {
             statements;
}

```
