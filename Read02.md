# Version Control  
Its a system record files changes and keep it accessible so we can look and comber new version of project with old ones .

## There are three types of version control :
 Local Version Control : like hard disks that save changes of files .
Centralized Version Control : its used when team work with group on project  everyone which has access privilege (write and read ) to project  can look and do changes .

Distributed Version Control :Its more like use both  above ways because it allows clients to create mirrored repositories and save it on the same time on central server , this protect data from last if the central server get damaged or data last .
